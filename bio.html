            <h2>Initial Blog</h2>

        <p>
          Today is a bright day, a good time is near. I just
          finished applying for the Live Mas scholarship and
          I am proud of my application. In addition, to a good
          attempt at the scholarship, I am working on creating a
          Python application. The application will be a tournament
          generator and a score counter. I will make the application
          be able to score count each game in a tournament then display
          the score once the game is completed. I will also program the
          application to display the winner in the next bracket and the
          loser in the following.

        <!--blog about the misunderstanding of AI-->
          <h2>Common views of "AI"</h2>

        <p>I was just conversing with a peer of mine, he stated
          "AI will save us and destroy us. They will cure cancer and
          old age." I attempted to explain to him that in no circumstance
          that computers or AI could cure cancer or end humanity.
          He did not want to hear that computers are dumb.
          He and others have a superhero or supervillain like view when AI
          is brought in on a conversation. He then explained to me the his worries about self-driving cars.
          He exclaimed, "I would never let a machine drive a car for me!". I said, "Why, not they can
          provide a safer alternative to human drivers". In the same conversation,
          two stigmas about computers and machines were brought to the surface.
          Moreover, The first stigma is the thought that computers can and
          "will" solve every problem. Computers are great but, like humans,
          they have their flaws. For example, a computer know's only what we tell the computer.
          If the boot is equal to one then that is true. Boot is nothing else to the computer unless
          we say it is. The mysterious legacy of the computer may never die, but it is
          our job as programmers to keep the beast at bay.
          Second is the fact that computers are untrustworthy.
          It seems almost contradictory, computers are going to take over humanity but, I
          will never trust one to drive! And the latter computers are dumb but they
          can be trusted
          Remember, I said computers only do what we tell them to. So, we can expect
          and predict what they will do. For example, Tesla uses video data from
          thousands of its customers to achieve a fully autonomous vehicle.
          Using billions of bytes of data Tesla Co tell's the computer what
          turns to make and when, when to stop, go, increase speed and so on.
          Computers have a bright future but, the public tends to get carried away.
          It is more important than ever to change the public view on AI;
          because it is only becoming more prevalent

        <!--blog about the freecode camp data-->
            <h2> <time>2020</time> developer's survey</h2>

        <p>Just a few day's ago freecodecamp and HackerRank released the <time>2020</time>
          developer skills report. I am pleasantly surprised by the result. Out of the total
           116,648 developers that participated in the percentage of developers without a
           traditional bachelors degree is 31.9% for companies 1-49 employees and 8.6% for
           companies 10,000 or more. The halt of the traditional degree is good news in my opinion,
          this allows more people to attempt and become software developers in our community.
          It also allows for different skill sets to be recognized in the community.
          Some data about today's current job field were also added. For example,
          the most demanded language skill that hiring managers want from developers
          is JavaScript, followed by Python than Java. Fortunately, A moderate sum
          of hiring managers are recognizing that developers can learn on the job
          with other languages and thrive. Lastly, Developers were asked what languages
          do you want to learn next? Now I am new to the tech community so I am not away
          new popular languages. Golang or just Go is the top choice of languages almost
          36 percent of developers are interested in learning next.
          Overall, I am glad to be aware of this study. The <time>2020</time> HackerRank developer
          skills report shedding some light on our field.
