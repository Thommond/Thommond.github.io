        Today is a bright day, a good time is near. I just
        finished applying for the Live Mas scholarship and
        I am proud of my application. In addition, to a good
        attempt at the scholarship, I am working on creating a
        Python application. The application will be a tournament
        generator and a score counter. I will make the application
        be able to score count each game in a tournament then display
        the score once the game is completed. I will also program the
        application to display the winner in the next bracket and the
        loser in the following.

      <p>I was just conversing with a peer of mine, he stated
        "AI will save us and destroy us. They will cure cancer and
        old age." I attempted to explain to him that in no circumstance
        that computers or AI could cure cancer or end humanity.
        He did not want to hear that computers are dumb.
        He and others have a superhero or supervillain like view when AI
        is brought in on a conversation. He then explained to me the his worries about self-driving cars.
        He exclaimed, "I would never let a machine drive a car for me!". I said, "Why, not they can
        provide a safer alternative to human drivers". In the same conversation,
        two stigmas about computers and machines were brought to the surface.
        Moreover, The first stigma is the thought that computers can and
        "will" solve every problem. Computers are great but, like humans,
        they have their flaws. For example, a computer know's only what we tell the computer.
        If the boot is equal to one then that is true. Boot is nothing else to the computer unless
        we say it is. The mysterious legacy of the computer may never die, but it is our job as programmers to keep the beast at bay.
        Second is the fact that computers are untrustworthy.
        It seems almost contradictory, computers are going to take over humanity but, I
        will never trust one to drive! And the latter computers are dumb but they
        can be trusted
        Remember, I said computers only do what we tell them to. So, we can expect
        and predict what they will do. For example, Tesla uses video data from
        thousands of its customers to achieve a fully autonomous vehicle.
        Using billions of bytes of data Tesla Co tell's the computer what
        turns to make and when, when to stop, go, increase speed and so on.
        Computers have a bright future but, the public tends to get carried away.
        It is more important than ever to change the public view on AI;
        because it is only becoming more prevalent
