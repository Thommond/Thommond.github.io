        <h3>Career change</h3>

        <p>I always wanted to be a welder. I spent my high school career
          taking shop classes and information extracurriculars about the
          trade. I had a half-day CTC program where I welded for 4 hours
          a day. The work was difficult to say the least. 3500+ degree flames
          and 100+ degree heat every day. However, I enjoyed my work creating
          grills, tables, small building frames and even motorcycles. But What
          made me reconsider my welding career was the environment not the
          work. Then, my junior year I decided I wanted a change of scenery
          so I got into web development. Ever since I discovered web dev I
          have been on a mission to improve my skills and change rapidly.</p>

        <h3>Business?</h3>

        <p>Ever since I was very young, I had a ambition to sell and
          create. I made a binder I called it my Idea binder. I planned
          trips, inventions, collaberation techniques and small businesses.
          For example, I started a cookie business in school, I "hired" a
          couple of my friends to sell all types of cookies that I baked from
          stratch. It was quite successful, we made about $300 a month. When
          you are in middle school thats a lot of money. We even expanded
          to candy and drinks. However, we were stopped by the Principal due
          to we were not allowed to sell unless is was through the school. I
          never stopped trying recycling businesses, yard sale resale, and
          3D printed wire holders. I am not stopping now either.</p>

        <h3>Hard work is key</h3>

        <p>What I have noticed in my short life time is you will not
          move up in society unless you work hard. That may seem obvious
          but realistly many spend their days unproductively and expect
          results or complain about the results they receive. I have no
          problem if you are comfortable where you are but for those who
          have a dream of their success but don't put in the work, they are
          lying to themselves. Continuing the same behavior over and over
          but expecting a different result is called insanity. Work, achive,
          fail, succeed this is the process. </p>

        <h3>Busy</h3>

        <p>The world is always moving with or without you. As a society
          we embrace information at every turn. Social media, radio, television
          web surfing, and much more. We are always occupied, always on the
          move but is it healthy? Thats a question for yourself to answer
          truly but I think not. There is no problem with the sharing of
          information however being occupied with every possible task may
          be to much for some to handle. What do we do about it? The internet
          and the vertial world is not going away if anything it will be more
          involved later down the road. However, it is an indivdual choice to
          "unplug" from time to time. Take a walk, play a sport, even just
          put your electronics down and read a book. Who knows you may enjoy
          a the break? </p>

        <h3>Appreciation</h3>

        <p>We learn during our lives to take the moment in and savor the
          good times. As children we observe and absorb the world around us.
          As teenagers we learn the ropes and want to experiment without a
          care in the world. The angsty teen who want to be alone but does not
          fully understand the magnitude of true responsiblity and acts like they
          do. Young adults, finally independent but always confused about their
          future. Then, the company. After the slow learning process of responsibl
          ity (which never ends), we take on new leaps of our life like a family,
          stable job and new adventures. Then, the routine of life settles in
          we get in the flow of work, family, relax and repeat. It may sound
          daunting but its quite the opposite. During every phase we learn and we
          live. Life is mysterious but never get discouraged because there is
          always a future, there is always reason for appreciation.</p>
