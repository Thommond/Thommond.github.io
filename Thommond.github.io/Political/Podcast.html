        <h3>Politics</h3>

        <p>As many of you probably know, I am highly involved in
          politics. So this inspired me to spread the word,
          my ideology and learn the ideologies of others. This
          podcast lead me to band others together in the name
          of change. Some examples of what we talk about with
          politics we discuss big issues like immigration,
          licensing, and much more.</p>


      </div>


      <div class="podcast">


        <h3>Abstract thought</h3>

        <p>On my podcast, we talk about anything that comes to
          mind. For example, we thought about the immense influence
          technology has had on society so we made a three part
          podcast on the impact of technology. Everything from the
          wheel to automation and its possibilities. The topic possibilities
          are endless.</p>


      </div>


      <div class="podcast">


        <h3>History</h3>

        <p>Ever since my first history class in grade school, I have
          been intriged with the outcome of history and its effects on
          the future. I often think throughout histories situations and
          what could have been accomplished.</p>


      </div>


      <div class="podcast">


        <h3>Hypotheticals</h3>

        <p>On the podcast, we often like to humor the possibilities if
          that is realistic or just a fantasy. For example, we talked
          about interdimensional aliens and we talked about if the $15
          minimum wage was actually enacted.</p>
