      <h2>My mission</h2>

      <p>I want to help society forward. I want to see my
        change in the making. I want to run for mayor. Unlike
        most jobs you can have an impact on everyone in society
        directly. I want to run for mayor to spread the belief of
        liberty, freedom, and the pursue of happiness. If I every
        have the previlege to be a mayor I hope to give people inspiration
        about the future and let others decide their path.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="mayor">

      <h2>Why Mayor?</h2>

      <p>I know that the responsibility of congress and governer may
        overwhelm me for my first public service. I want to effect a
        small group of people so I can focus on their problems to make
        life easier for them. I can solve the problems the few which is
        just as important as serving the needs of the many. When you are
        mayor people thank you face-to-face or tell you their struggles
        and you can truly connect.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="mayor">

      <h2>Why me?</h2>

      <p>Why am I worthy of being a mayor? I can't say I am the best or
        that I am the one to change the town better than ever before.
        However, That is my goal. I want to stick up for the individual
        and support the people at every possible turn. Together
        is how we change for the better. </p>
