        <div class="consider">

          <p>I consider myself a Agorist - Libertarian. If you dont know what
            <!--Make Agorist and Libertarian link to the wikapida page about them-->
            is not to worry read up on it or read a brief summary from me.
            Agorism- The belief that as long as actions are done with consent and
            are voluntary to all parties affected then it is legal. Libertarianism
            is a bit more complicated so for that one read up the topic on Wikapedia
          </p>




          <p>For the record I am supportive of many conservative polices but when it
            comes down to it libertarians support the strongest individual rights. Unlike
            the Democrats or Republicans, Libertarians support gun rights, LGBTQ+ rights,
            deregulation, the slash of our budget, ingesting what ever you want and of course
            life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

        <div class="list">
          <p>To show you in more detail, here is a list.</p>

          <ul>

            <li>I consider myself a pro-life individual</li>
            <li>I am for open borders</li>
            <li>I support heavy deregulation of the free market</li>
            <li>I support LGBTQ+ rights but they will not be government funded</li>
            <li>I do not support government action on climate change</li>
            <li>I do not support our current military policy or spending</li>
            <li>I am supportive of legalization of Cannabis, Psycoactive
              mushrooms and the decriminalization of all drugs</li>
            <li>I am against any infringment of the constitution</li>
            <li>Most importantly I support the people over power</li>

          </ul>

      <section class="current">
<div class="gov">
        <h2>Current Government polices</h2>

        <p>What I take rather seriously is the spending problem congress
          and most government offices possess. I am fully against unessary
          spending. What is unessary? I support dramaticly cutting our foriegn
          aid, welfare, social security, medicare/medicaid, and military spending.
          A saying I live by is what ever the government can do the free market
          can do it better.</p>

        <p>Just to make a note I would like to tell my supporters that I do
          not take the violation of the privacy of americans very well. I do not
          support red flag laws, TSA, the Patriot Act, warrantless searches/seiz
          ures and last but not least the collection of meta data. </p>
