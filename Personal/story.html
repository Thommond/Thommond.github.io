      <h3>Career change</h3>

      <p>I always wanted to be a welder. I spent my highschool career
        taking shop classes and information extracuriculars about the
        trade. I had a half day ctc program where I welded for 4 hours
        a day. The work was diffucult to say the least. 3500+ degree flames
        and 100+ degree heat every day. However I enjoyed my work creating
        grills, tables,small building frames and even motercylces. But What
        made me reconsider my welding career was the enviorment not the
        work. Then, my junior year I decieded I wanted a change of scenery
        so I got into web development. Ever since I discovered web dev I
        have been on a mission to improve my skills and change rapidly.</p>

    <h3>Business?</h3>

    <p>Ever since I was very young I had a ambition to sell and
      create. I made a binder I called it my Idea binder. I planned
      trips, inventions, collaberation techniques and small businesses.
      For example, I started a cookie business in school, I "hired" a
      couple of my friends to sell all types of cookies that I baked from
      stratch. It was quite successful, we made about 300 a month. When
      you are in middle school thats a lot of money. We even expanded
      to candy and drinks. However we were stoped by the principle due
      to we were not allowed to sell unless is was through the school. I
      never stopped trying recycleing businesses, yard sale resale, and
      3D printed wire holders. I am not stopping now either.</p>

    <h3>Hard work is key</h3>

    <p>What I have noticed in my short life time is you will not
      move up in society unless you work hard. That may seem obvious
      but realistly many spend thier days unproductivly and expect
      results or complain about the results they recieve. I have no
      problem if you are comfortable where you are but for those who
      have a dream of their success but dont but in the work, they are
      lying to themselves. Continuing the same behaviour over and over
      but expecting a different result is called insanity. Work,achive,
      fail,succed this is the process. </p>

    <h3>Busy</h3>

    <p>The world is always moving with or without you. As a society
      we embrase information at ever turn. Social media, radio, television
      web surfing, and much more. We are always occupied, always on the
      move but is it healthy? Thats a question for yourself to answer
      truley but I think not. There is no problem with the sharing of
      information however being occupied with every possible task may
      be to much for some to handle. What do we do about it? The internet
      and the vertial world is not going away if anything it will be more
      involed later down the road. However, it is an indivdual choice to
      "unplug" from time to time. Take a walk, play a sport, even just
      put your electronics down and read a book. Who knows you may enjoy
      a the break? </p>

    <h3>Appreciation</h3>

    <p>We learn durning our lives to take the moment in and savor the
      good times. As children we observe and absorb the world around us.
      As teenagers we learn the ropes and want to experiment without a
      care in the world. The ansty teen who want to be alone but does not
      fully understand the magnitude of true responsiblity and acts like they
      do. Young adults, finally independent but always confused about their
      future. Then, the company. After the slow learning process of responsibl
      ity (which never ends), we take on new leaps of our life like a family,
      stable job and new adventures. Then, the routine of life settles in
      we get in the flow of work, family, relax and repeat. It may sound
      daunting but its quite the opposite. During every phase we learn and we
      live. Life is mysterious but never get discouraged becuase their is
      always a future, their is always reason for apperciation.</p>
