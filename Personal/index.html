      <h2>Hobbies</h2>

      <p>I have quite a bit of hobbies but if I had to tone it down to
        three I would choose cycling, non-fiction reading and the great out
        doors.</p>

      <section id="cycling" class='hobbies'>
        <!--My section on cycling-->

        <h3>Cycling</h3>
        <img src="../Images/Staunton-Bicycling.jpg" class="hobby" alt="A man riding
      a bike on a road by grass">
        <p>I am a big fan of taking a break during the week to go on
          a long brisk bike ride. I like the workout and that feeling
          of accomplishment at the end of the ride. Most importantly no
          matter how busy my life or my fellow riders lives are we still
          make it to our weekly rides. It brings us together!</p>

        <h3>Non-Fiction Reading</h3>
        <img src="../Images/image-for-non-fiction-books.jpg" class="hobby" alt="a book open halfway
      with Abraham Lincoln on the left and the words non-fiction books">
        <p>I do enjoy lots of genres of books but my favorite by far
          is Non-fiction. I enjoy non-fiction reading the most due to
          the satisfaction I get from learning and using something new.
          Non-fiction lets the reader carry the facts however they please,
          me personally I make a story about the information instead
          of the author doing it for me! </p>

        <h3>The Great Outdoors</h3>
        <img src="../Images/Great-Smoke.jpg" class="hobby" alt="Sunsetting with mountians,
      trees covering the mountians and they are surrounding a vally">
        <p>There is so much to love about nature but to keep this small I
          will be brief. When I feel stressed or just want some leisure time
          I will get outside. Ever since I was a small boy the sight of trees
           or the sound of the animals would give me joy. After all who doesn't
            love nature?</p>
