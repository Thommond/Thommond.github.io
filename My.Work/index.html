          <h3>The basics</h3>


          <p>I know it may seem empty but part of my
            work is the website you have been navigating! I am in
            the process of becoming a computer software engineer.
            I have only have learned a few skills so far but I am going
            to eventually have seven programming languages when I am done.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Here is my skills list</h3>

        <p>I am in a class called CSET at Thaddeus Stevens College of
          technology. The class teaches web develpment, code, and much
          more.
          For all the projects referenced below check them out on my
          github <a href="https://github.com/Thommond?tab=repositories">here for my github</a></p>

        <h3>Command-Line</h3>

        <p id='Command Line'>

          The Command-Line is the first basic skill I adopted as a software
          engineer. I learned how to navigate my computer to the fullest extent.
          File management and a plethora of command-line commands were the bulk
          of my command line experience. Other skills include practice with file paths
          navigation, bug fixing, and proper storage habits.

        </p>

        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>

        <p id='htmlAndCss'>

          Html was the first web-based skill I learned in my software development
          education. Shortly after my professor introduced HTML, CSS was the next step.
          I was assigned various exercises such as a remix meaning merging several
          websites to create a completely different website. Some of the HTML projects
          I completed include semantic and syntax tests and labs which have given me
          some insight into the flow of HTML. In addition to my experience with tests
          and exercises, I have created two websites from scratch. One is the
          the website you are one and another an art website.

        </p>

        <h3>Git Version Control</h3>

        <p id='git'>

          Another skill I have learned is Git version control. I was taught
          Git due to its prominent popularity and uses in the workforce.
          Git practice with merge conflicts, branches, basic commands,
          GitHub, and many more practical skills. Every project that
          I work on to this day includes git and the web platform GitHub.

      <section id='intermediateLanguages' class='mywork'>

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>

        <p id='JavaScript'>JavaScript was my initial web development language. I was taught
          based on the eloquent JavaScript book. I learned valuable skills such as data types,
           operators, functions, practical uses and finally the document object model (DOM).
           The knowledge I gathered allowed me to create a JavaScript maze game with another peer.
           Some other projects I have worked on include exercises and quizzes. For example,
           we completed popular software
          problems such as looping a triangle, bean-counting and recreating math minimum.
          In addition, I have also begun to learn JSON and higher operations with JavaScript
          like higher-order functions or animations.</p>

        <h3>Python</h3>

        <p id='Python'>
          The second language I am currently learning is Python. Since I have
            software language experience the basics of Python were easily surpassed.
            As of today <time>01/25/2020</time> I am being taught classes in Python.
            Some of the projects I have already completed include function practice,
            importing files, entry skills with operators, data types and a start
            to my own python command-line game. In the upcoming weeks,
            I will be taught much more complex skills with Python and will update this website accordingly.
        </p>

        <h3>SQL</h3>
        <p id='sql'>
          SQL is a database language for managing tasks on the 'backend' of development.
          For the most part, SQL is my first backend language. I am absorbing skills like
          table creation, database management system practice and detailed exercises with SQL
          commands. However, I have just scratched the surface with SQL,
          my class has much more to teach me in the upcoming months.

      <section id='OtherSkills' class='mywork'>

        <h3>Other Works</h3>

        <p>Not only am I learning to become a software engineer, I am being taught other
          valuable skills along with development. The skills include microsoft office, public
          speaking, proffessional wrinting, and necessary mathamatics. Moreover, I know how to
          use and manage window, mac and linux computers. I know how to create proffessional
          documents such as memos, essays, speeches, and evaluations. My classes have taught me
          to be comfortable around a crowd as well as to work with teams.</p>
      </section>

      <section id='ComingUp'class='mywork'>

        <h3>Upcoming</h3>
        <p>
          Upcoming projects include more detail into Python and SQL. To build a massive interactive
          website with 3 to 4 other peers, based on our school portal. Furthermore,
          I will also have security experience which will teach me to have secure
          habits and to seek as well as fix any bugs or security risks I can find.
          The upcoming class will assist me in spotting
          weaknesses in website security and improve over bug fix performance.
