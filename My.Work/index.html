          <p>I know it may seem empty but part of my
            work is the website you have been navigating! I am in
            the process of becoming a computer software engineer.
            I have only have learned a few skills so far but I am going
            to eventually have seven programming languages when I am done.</p>

        <p>I am in a class called CSET at Thaddeus Stevens College of
          technology. The class teaches web develpment, code, and much
          more.
          For all the projects referenced below check them out on my
          github <a href="https://github.com/Thommond?tab=repositories">here</a></p>

      <section class='entrySkills'>
        <p id='Command Line'>
          The Command Line is the first basic skill I adopted as a software
          engineer. I learned how to navigate my computer to the fullest extent.
          File managment and a plethera of command line commands was the bulk of
          my command line experience. Other skills include practice with file paths
          navigation, bug fixing and proper storage habits.
        </p>
        <p id='htmlAndCss'>
          Html was the first web based skill I learned in my software development
          education. Shortly after my proffessor introduced html, Css was
          the next step. I was assigned various exercises such as a remix
          meaning merging several websites together to create a completely
          different website. Some of the html projects I completed include
          semantic and syntax tests and labs which have given me some insight
          into the flow of html. In addition to my experience with tests and
          exercises I have created a two websites from stratch. One is the
          website you are one and another a art website.
        </p>

        <p id='git'>
          Another skill I have learned is Git version control. I was taught
          Git due to it's promenet popularity and uses in the workforce. Git
          practice with merge conflicts, branches, basic commands, github, and
          many more practical skills. Every project that I work on to this day
          includes git and the web platform github.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class='intermediateLanguages'>

        <p id='JavaScript'>JavaScript was my initial web developent language. I was taught
          based off of the eloquent JavaScript book. I learned valuable skills
          such as data types, operators, functions, practical uses and finally the
          document object model (DOM). The knowlage I gathered allowed me to create
          a JavaScript maze game with another peer. Some other projects I have worked
          on include exercises and quizes. For example we completed popular software
          problems such as looping a triangle, bean counting and recreating math minumum.
          In addition, I have also began to learn JSON and higher operations with JavaScript
          like higher order functions or animations.</p>


        <p id='Python'>
          The second language I am currently learning is Python. Since I have
          software language experience the basics of Python were easily surpassed.
          As of today <time>01/25/2020</time> I am being taught classes in Python.
          Some of the projects I have already completed include function practice,
          importing files, entry skills with operators, data types and a start to
          my own python command line game. In the upcoming weeks I will be taught
          much more complex skills with Python and will update this website accordingly.
        </p>

        <p id='sql'>
          Sql is a databasing language for managing task's on the 'backend' of development.
          For the most part SQL is my first backend language. I am absorbing skills like table
          creation, database management system practice and detailed exercies with sql
          commands. However, I have just stratched the surface with sql, my class has
          much more to teach me in the upcoming months.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class='OtherSkills'>
        <p>Not only am I learning to become a software engineer, I am being taught other
          valuable skills along with development. The skills include microsoft office, public
          speaking, proffessional wrinting, and necessary mathamatics. Moreover, I know how to
          use and manage window, mac and linux computers. I know how to create proffessional
          documents such as memos, essays, speeches, and evaluations. My classes have taught me
          to be comfortable around a crowd as well as to work with teams.</p>
      </section>

      <section class='ComingUp'>
        Upcoming projects include more detail into Python and SQL. To build a massive interative
        website with 3 to 4 other peers, based off of our school portal. Furthermore, I will also
        have security experience which will teach me to have secure habits and to seek as well as
        fix any bugs or secuirty risks I can find. The upcoming class will assit me in spotting
        weeknesses in website security and improve over bug fix performance.
