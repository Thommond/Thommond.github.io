            <h3>The N.A.P</h3>

            <p>The N.A.P stands for the Non-Aggression Pact. This means
              it is an agreed upon law which states anyone who shows aggression
              in the form of violence is violating the law. Not just getting an
              gry, its more than that. N.A.P. violations include assualt, harra
              ssment,rape, theft, violation of contract, murder and etc. As you
              can see its not as simple as it my sound. More on the N.A.P at
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="gun">

            <h3>Gun policy</h3>

            <p>Libertarian gun policy is actual quite simple. We support the
              right to own, and use your firearm and other weapons if needed.
              Moreover, Libertarians don't support any weapons ban including
              weapons attachments and much more. It's your right what autho
              rity to we have to stop you?</p>

          </div>

          <div class=drug>

            <h3>Drug policy</h3>

            <p>Libertarian drug policy is a bit more complicated. We support the
              decriminalization of all drugs and the legalization of cannabis and
              pychoactive mushrooms. We support changing the goal from punishment
              to rehabilitation with non-criminal drug offenders.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="healthcare">

            <h3>Healthcare Policy</h3>

            <p>Many Libertarians support the complete abolishment of government
              healthcare, although I agree in long term measures I would like to
              prepose a 5 year plan to abolish the federal healthcare system. what
              would replace it? The free market will allow for cheap alternatives.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="taxes">

            <h3>Taxes and fees</h3>

            <p>Libertarian taxation polices are much more leinient then our
              counterparts. We propose taxes as low as 14% flat rate. Why flat
              rate? Rich tax payers don't pay 90% of their taxes due to cheap avenues
              of excape. With a flat rate it would not be worth their time avoiding
              the tax. I personally support the abolishment of the property, sales,
              and luxuries taxes.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="foriegn">

            <h3>Foriegn policy</h3>

            <p>Libertarian foreign policy is straight to the point. Libertatians
              understand the importance of a strong military, but we are isolation
              ists. Military should only be for defence and needed conflict. At the
              current military state Libertarians would highly decrease our footprint
              in foriegn wars, and establish bases only in defensive positions. The
              seeking of wars will stop. Moreover, other foreign policy includes the
              complete defunding of foreign aid in a 3 year period.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="public">

            <h3>Public programs</h3>

            <p>Libertarians support the end of welfare and other programs that
              drain the national and local budget. It would be in a periodic fashion
              for about 5 years. Why? Most program for example SNAP are not achieving
              their intended goal and instead are having negative effects including,
              corruption, malpractice, and bottle necking.</p>

        <h2>Libertarain Core beliefs</h2>

        <div class="values">

          <h3>Indivdual choice</h3>

          <p>What Many Libertarians and I support is absolute freedom.
            we believe that the rights of indivdual people are most important.
            Libertarians have the thought of the people and their welfare in
            every decison we make. We believe that individuals are responsible
            for themselves and nothing more. This does not mean collaberation is
            not as important but Libertarians acknowledge the choice that every
            person needs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="values">

          <h3>Do no harm</h3>

          <p>Many Libertarians including myself feel obligated to do no harm at
            consequence. We do not condone any action that leads or causes to the
            intentional harm of another individual. That is why we created the N.A.P.
            to keep others and ourselves in check. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="values">

          <h3>Free markets</h3>

          <p>Libertarians recognize the importance of a centralized power but stress
            the need of free interaction. A great portion of what Libertarins strive
            for is people selling, producing, trading and living without government being
            in every part of their lives. We don't hold grudges or bottle neck our
            competition out of the spot light. Thats the power of the indivdual. </p>
